  Kavak Tech Challenge July 11 2020
</h1>

This project was done as part of a tech challenge by Kavak for a developer position. Sadly I only made it halfway through the requirements for the forms challenge, algorithm test was completed.

Project is using GatsbyJS' default starter.

## ðŸš€ Run Project

In order to run project:

1. Clomne repo into your machine
2. install dependencies using yarn with `yarn install`

Thank you for your consideration!

As a side note I do plan on finishing up this challenge on a different branch in case you would like to take a look!
